# ðŸš€ Project 11: GitHub Browser Automation

This project automates a series of actions on **GitHub** using **Puppeteer**. The script performs the following tasks:

âœ… **Login to GitHub** using credentials stored in a local `credentials.json` file.  
âœ… **Star a list of repositories** if they are not already starred.  
âœ… **Create a starred list** named **"Node Libraries"** to organize your starred repositories.  
âœ… **Add starred repositories** to the "Node Libraries" list.
